# ros course

This repo was created to preserve the results of the "Advanced Topics in Computer Science" course at the Technion University.
Course summary:
The course will review different approaches to the design and planning of single-robot systems and multi-robot systems. Tools for the efficient design of these systems come from a variety of areas of artificial intelligence (AI), such as automated design and serial decision-making under non-critical conditions.
Certainty, model-based inference, game theory, multi-agent systems, learning reinforcement and more.
The course will include both learning of various theoretical tools for modeling multi-robot systems and practical work of robots in a ROS environment.

Exercise 1:
Basic understanding of the robot world in ROS.

Exercise 2:
Divided into two tasks where the first is to cover an unmapped area under a time limit, and the second is an area mapping with a time limit.

Exercise 3:
Managed for a multi-robot environment, when it too is divided into two tasks. The first is to cover space effectively by a number of robots with a time limit, and the second is to clean a fully-mapped environment with an adversary agent.

The explanation for the solution to the exercises can be seen in the attached presentations.
